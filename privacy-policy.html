  <h1>Privacy Policy — SAIDU</h1>
  <p><strong>SAIDU</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) is a party games app. This policy describes how we and our partners handle information when you use the app.</p>

  <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Information stored only on your device</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Preferences you set in the app (e.g. language).</li>
    <li>Other on-device data the app needs to work (e.g. that you have completed onboarding).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is not sent to our servers and is not linked to your identity elsewhere.</p>

  <p><strong>Information used by third-party advertising</strong></p>
  <p>Our app shows ads provided by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. Google and its partners may collect or use:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong> (e.g. advertising ID) to deliver and measure ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising data</strong> (e.g. which ads you see or interact with) for ad serving and measurement.</li>
    <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> (coarse location) for ad relevance, when available.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data may be linked to your device or identity and used for advertising and tracking across apps and websites. You can control ad tracking via your device settings and the permission prompt we show in the app (App Tracking Transparency).</p>

  <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>On-device data:</strong> To run the app (e.g. language, game state).</li>
    <li><strong>Ad-related data:</strong> Used by Google AdMob to show and measure ads, and for third-party advertising and related analytics. We do not control how Google uses this data; their practices are described in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data we do not collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect your name, email, phone number, or other contact information. We do not require an account to use the app. We do not sell your personal data.</p>

  <h2>4. Children</h2>
  <p>SAIDU is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

  <h2>5. Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can accept or decline the in-app tracking prompt (App Tracking Transparency). Declining may limit personalized ads but will not stop ads from showing.</li>
    <li>You can reset or limit the advertising identifier in your device settings (e.g. iOS: Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking / Advertising).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The current version will be available at this page. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or SAIDU’s practices, please contact us at the support or contact address you provide in the app or on the App Store listing.</p>
